Personal settings and stuff.

This repo uses git submodules (e.g. for vim plugins). You probably want to
fetch them:
```
git submodule update --init
```

Notes
=====

 * The misc dir is important (it hooks in some things like the myrc scripts...)
 * I am too lazy to write a installer shell script, since i don't have to do it a lot.
