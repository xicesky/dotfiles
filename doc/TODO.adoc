== Things to improve

* Make environment system work with systemd
    systemd offers environment directories (see e.g. https://man.archlinux.org/man/environment.d.5) which we can use to set environment variables for all services.
    Sadly these only refresh on re-login, but they will provide their values on all services, not just login terminals with bash/zsh.
