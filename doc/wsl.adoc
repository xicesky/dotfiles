== TODO

* Currently i still use https://github.com/BlackReloaded/wsl2-ssh-pageant[wsl2-ssh-pageant], but i plan to replace this by https://blog.mayflower.de/12736-git-wsl2.html[forwarding the ssh-agent directly to my windows host].
* I intend to fully migrate to homebrew-on-whatever (works on osx and multiple linux distros)

== Installer script

[source,bash]
----
curl -LO "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xicesky/dotfiles/main/installer/install-wsl2-stuff.sh"
chmod +x install-wsl2-stuff.sh

# Since we still use the old solution, we need to setup wsl2-ssh-pagent first:
./install-wsl2-stuff.sh init-ssh-pageant
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$HOME/.ssh/agent.sock"
ssh-add -l

# Now run the installer
./install-wsl2-stuff.sh install

# Reboot wsl2 from powershell, as the script tells you
# wsl --shutdown
# Then launch a new wsl2 terminal (the old one will be defunct)

# Change shell (purposely not automated)
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
zsh

----

== Other tips

* To share a directory between different wsl2 distros, simply bind-mount it in /mnt/wsl
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p /mnt/wsl/share-OLD-Ubuntu-22.04/ && wsl.exe -d "Ubuntu-22.04" -u root mount --bind / /mnt/wsl/share-Ubuntu-22.04/
